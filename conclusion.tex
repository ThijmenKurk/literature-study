\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
\todo{Conclusion of your investigation, including (i) few sentence to introduce the topic considered, (ii) short summary of the research method followed, (iii) main findings, and (iv) potential implications and future work}
This study gives an overview of modern microservice architectures in the form of a model and identified three data management challenges and their potential solutions by systematically analyzing the latest studies on microservices using well-known literature review methods \cite{syslit1, syslit2,syslit3,syslit4}.

We found that microservices consist of four layers: (i) Runtime, (ii) Communication, (iii) Coordination and (iv) Logic, with one overarching layer being Security. These microservices are connected with each other to form a microservice architecture. There are four types of microservices: (i) Business, (ii) Utility, (iii) Persistence and (iv) Middleware. Additionally, we found three data management challenges: (i) inter-microservice data relations, (ii) inter-microservice data transactions and (iii) inter-microservice query aggregation and joining. We conclude that microservice architectures are evolving but that they are far from mature, given the fact that not all data management challenges have general solutions.

In the future we would like to explore how to solve the challenge described in Section~\ref{sec:foreign} by proposing a general solution for this problem.
