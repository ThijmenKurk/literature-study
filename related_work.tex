Numerous secondary studies on MSA have been performed \cite{Garriga2018203,Alshuqayran201644,Pahl2016137,Soldani2018215,Taibi2018221,DiFrancesco201977,Hamzehloui20191079}. A majority of these studies aim to provide an overview of what components generally reside in an MSA including but not limited to, how quality attributes \cite{o2007quality} can be applied to each of these components \cite{Garriga2018203, Alshuqayran201644, Pahl2016137}. Whereas others concentrate on the patterns in which these components can be utilized most effectively within MSAs \cite{Taibi2018221,richardson2018microservices, Akbulut201919,IBMBook,Messina2016223,5-newman2021building}.

This study distills the work published on MSAs into a model by iterating through studies systematically. In contrast to the work mentioned above, we put the focus on creating a general model of MSAs, instead of enumerating organizational aspects or specific patterns.
