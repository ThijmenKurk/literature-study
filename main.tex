  \todo{The abstract of the study goes here. A good abstract shortly summarizes the paper by covering: (i) a presentation of the topic covered, (ii) the research followed, (iii) the main findings of the study, and (iv) the outcome of the investigation}

  A microservice architecture is an interconnected web of small independent services that each run in its own process while interacting with each other using messages. These architectures are still evolving giving rise to the need for literature reviews. We aim at identifying and classifying definitions and patterns found in microservice architectures described by scientific literature into a concise model. Additionally, we set out to identify challenges found in inter-microservice data management and classify their possible solutions.
  Towards this goal, we apply well-known systematic literature review methods. Following these methods, we selected 21 relevant studies and iteratively updated our model based on these studies.
  This work contributes (i) a general model of a modern microservice architectures and (ii) an overview of challenges and solutions within inter-microservice data management.
