\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
\todo{In this section, the results of the literature review should be reported. This section can be split up according to the specific focus of the literature review, e.g. Publication Trends, Research Focus, and Potential for Industrial Adoption (see Running example)}
This literature review aimed to model modern MSAs and the important components within them. This provides researchers with an overview of important aspects and layers to consider while implementing MSAs. We found similar studies within our selection of literature, but these studies considered different aspects of MSAs (e.g., organizational aspects or architectural aspects) instead of implementation aspects.

Additionally, this study derived three challenges and potential solutions for data management problems within MSAs from the selected literature. The lack of solutions for some of these challenges show that MSAs are still evolving and not fully mature yet.
