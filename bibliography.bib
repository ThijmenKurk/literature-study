  abstract  = {Background: Systematic literature studies have become common in software engineering, and hence it is important to understand how to conduct them efficiently and reliably.Objective: This paper presents guidelines for conducting literature reviews using a snowballing approach, and they are illustrated and evaluated by replicating a published systematic literature review.Method: The guidelines are based on the experience from conducting several systematic literature reviews and experimenting with different approaches.Results: The guidelines for using snowballing as a way to search for relevant literature was successfully applied to a systematic literature review.Conclusions: It is concluded that using snowballing, as a first search strategy, may very well be a good alternative to the use of database searches.},
