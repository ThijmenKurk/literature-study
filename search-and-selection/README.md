# Search and Selection
This directory contains everything used during the search and selection phase of the study. This includes:
* Raw data for each [intermediate step](../images/search-and-selection.pdf).
* The notebook used to process data ([found here](process.ipynb)). This notebook runs with `jupyter notebook` but first requires `pip3 -r requirements.txt` to be executed.
